Pristine (8757NC) aims to be a customizable AS3 space combat simulator with multiplayer gameplay. Right now, the multiplayer component is on hold until the main engine is complete.

The gameplay will consist of classic spaceflight sim with gameplay akin to the X-Wing series of games, but with more modern mechanics, such as semi-realistic newtonian physics as seen in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica.

"Pristine" is a reference to the Viper MKII piloted by Kara Thrace (Starbuck) as she reappears after her own death.
