		firerate is ms between shots per cannon
	    the number of firepods must match the count
		order is the order in which the pods will fire if set to alternate-single fire mode 
		offsets are where the actual shot is created from, ie: the end of the barre
		offsets are from the center middle back of the craft, facing forward, in meters
		-x is left, +x is right, -y is up, +y is down, -z is behind, +z is into the screen

		The Alliance brain trust of General Jan Dodonna and engineer Walex Blissex developed the A-wing starfighter after examining the role of speed in the Battle of Yavin and the sleek fighters developed by the Tamuuz-an. The top-secret result of their experimentation was the A-wing, the fastest vessel of the Galactic Civil War.
